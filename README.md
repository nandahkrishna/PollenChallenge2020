# ICPR 2020 Pollen Grain Classification Challenge

This repository contains code for our submissions to the ICPR 2020 Pollen Grain Classification Challenge. Our submissions were based on a two-stage model, composed of a U-Net (segmentation) and a VGG-16 (classification). For more details on the challenge, visit the [webpage](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/pollenclassificationchallenge/). This work was done together with [Abhijith Ragav](https://github.com/abhijithragav).
